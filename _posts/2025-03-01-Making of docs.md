# My Docs Site: The Making Of

## Credit

Before I start, I want to give credit where it's due:

- Partial inspiration for this project: [NetworkChuck's vid on his blog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnE7c0ELEH8)
- Theme and good instructions: [Techno Tim's vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8iOU1ci19Q)
- Python Code for images: [NetworkChuck's blog](https://blog.networkchuck.com/posts/my-insane-blog-pipeline/)

## Inspiration

I have wanted to start a blog for a while now, but it's kind of taken a backseat in my mind. It came back up when I bought a domain name. I thought, "Wouldn't it be cool if I had a blog?" Then later I learned about [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), free hosting, and I also thought, "What can I do with this?" Then I watched a little bit of the aforementioned video from [NetworkChuck](https://www.youtube.com/@NetworkChuck) and then I started research.

## Research

Soon after discovering Github Pages, I found [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a really simple static site generator. I found the [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) theme soon after by watching [Techno Tim's vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8iOU1ci19Q) on Jekyll, and I kind of liked it. So, I decided to use those.

## Making

I tried to follow Techno Tim's video on my Macbook Pro, but soon failed. Ruby and bundle kept on giving me errors that I had no idea how to deal with, so I almost gave up. However, I remembered that I had a laptop with linux on it (my fav operation sys btw), so I tried on that. Somehow it worked, and I was able to get a start on the project. Somehow many things stopped working, so I stopped. 

During this period, the site took a backseat as I worked on my server and my Jellyfin music library. 

A few week ago I pretty much finished up on the music server and decieded to come back to this project. After trying out Hugo with NetworkChuck's video, where I had a brief period of success, I gave up on it. Hugo was just less documented, and, for me, harder to work with. I came back to Jekyll and tried again. I got the config and favicon to work (one of my pain points) and finally got the posts to work. After a struggle with Cloudflare and Github Pages, I got a custom domain working. This part was quite a bit of a struggle with many DNS failures, and confusion too. 

Sorry if this was a bit of a bad write up, I don't remember many of the details since this is obviously after the making of. I will write as I go along next time.
