In a previous article (or maybe one in the future, idk), I describe how we picked out an android auto screen and set it up on my dad's car. 

## Thoughts so far in no particular order:

- mount is not the most secure thing in the world, so a little wobby
	- maybe due to not using stock mount?
- front camera is pretty useless, I'm not entirely sure what it's supposed to do
- yet to see how the backup camera performs, that's another project that I suppose will be pretty hard
- aux cable is a bit annoying
- the bootup time is reasonable, and the auto connect is pretty fast
- the auto sync is good
- both the aux and the FM audio transfer works, but the FM seems to have some noise in our testing, just a faint buzz in the background, so we just used the aux
	- the built in speakers also work, but not really even worth the mention because of the HORRIBLE quality (not sure why I put this in then)
- For $60, not half bad (no complaints)
- screen resolution is not the best, but kinda to be expected at this price point
- screen is pretty big
- auto connects pretty well
